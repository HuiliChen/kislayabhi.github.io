## Current Projects

Right now I am working on three things.

- Working on a Nvidia Jetson TX1 GPU. Our Robotics lab has lots of sequential Computer Vision code and I am trying to use the power of CUDA to make them run in real time.

- Writing a compiler from scratch for the language C-- . Hah! I know you must never have heard about it before but it is very much like C except the pointers. A good way to learn the functioning of Compiler without over complicating it! I am doing this as a class project under Professor Antonia Zhai.

- Writing blog posts and cool C codes [here](https://github.com/kislayabhi/short_scripts)

## Past Projects

IPython notebooks are a great way to learn python. Herein, I have developed some lucid notebooks showcasing a mixture of Computer Vision and Machine Learning techniques!

Check these out and write your own! :)

### IPython Notebooks

#### Automatic Number Plate Recognition

- [Project link](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/kislayabhi/89b985e5b78a6f56029a/ANPR.ipynb)
- I wrote this back when I was involved in Google Summer of Code with Shogun Machine Learning toolbox. This system is about detecting automobile license plate in photographs taken between 1-2 meters from a car. It is a robust example showcasing the unification of image processing techniques along with pattern recognition algorithms like SVM and ANN.

#### PCA and its application in face recognition
- [Project link](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/static/notebook/current/pca_notebook.html)
- Again this was the outcome of a great Summer of Code as mentioned above. This system shows the usage of Principal Component Analysis for general data compression. Its dimensional reduction capabilities are further utilized to show its application in Eigenfaces Face recognition algorithm.

#### Object categorization using SIFT
- [Project link](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/kislayabhi/abb68be1b0be7148e7b7)
- This system differentiates between images containing a car, a train and a plane. The category of the image is decided on the basis of SIFT descriptors. K-means clustering is employed for generating bag-of-keypoints and multiclass SVMs are used for the prediction of the category of the object.

#### Active Appearance Model
- [Project link](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/kislayabhi/0cc4f6e6b625873c15de)
- Here I developed a parameterized face needed by the Active Appearance Model (AAM), where the variability of shape and texture is captured from a representative training set. PCA on shape and texture is applied to produce the face model which describes the trained faces with a photorealistic quality.Visit ([here](http://kislayvision.com/research/active-appearance-models/)) for more details.

### Kaggle!
#### How much did it rain 2
- This was done as a class project under Professor Arindam Banerjee. We took this challenge as it was ongoing at the time of our course of Machine Learning. ( CSCI 5525 at University of Minnesota.)
