## Current Projects

Here in I will try to publish the work I am currently doing.

## Past Projects

### Python Notebooks
1. ([Automatic Number Plate Recognition Notebook](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

* I wrote this back when I was involved in Google Summer of Code with Shogun Machine Learning toolbox. This system is about detecting automobile license plate in photographs taken between 1-2 meters from a car. It is a robust example showcasing the unification of image processing techniques along with pattern recognition algorithms like SVM and ANN.

2. ([PCA and its application in face recognition](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/static/notebook/current/pca_notebook.html))

* Again this was the outcome of a great Summer of Code as mentioned above. This system shows the usage of Principal Component Analysis for general data compression. Its dimensional reduction capabilities are further utilized to show its application in Eigenfaces algorithm.

3. ([Object categorization using SIFT](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/kislayabhi/abb68be1b0be7148e7b7))

* This system differentiates between images containing a car, a train and a plane. The category of the image is decided on the basis of SIFT descriptors. K-means clustering is employed for generating bag-of-keypoints and multiclass SVMs are used for the prediction of the category of the object.

4. ([Active Appearance Model](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/kislayabhi/0cc4f6e6b625873c15de))

* Here I developed a parameterized face needed by the Active Appearance Model (AAM), where the variability of shape and texture is captured from a representative training set. PCA on shape and texture is applied to produce the face model which describes the trained faces with a photorealistic quality.Visit ([here](http://kislayvision.com/research/active-appearance-models/)) for more details.
